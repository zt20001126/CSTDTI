CSTDTI: Convolutional-Self-Attention Transformer for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction
Overview
Welcome to the CSTDTI project! CSTDTI is a novel deep learning framework designed for predicting Drug-Target Interactions (DTI) with high accuracy and interpretability. It leverages a Multi-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (MCGIN) for drug molecule representation, a Convolutional-Self-Attention Transformer (ConvSE-Transformer) for protein sequence modeling, and a hierarchical cross-attention fusion module to capture complex interactions between drugs and targets. Our model addresses challenges such as structural similarity in drug molecules, long-range dependencies in protein sequences, and the need for interpretable predictions in drug discovery.

Current Status
At this time, the code for CSTDTI is still being organized and refined. We are actively working to ensure that the codebase is well-documented, clean, and user-friendly before making it publicly available. We apologize for the delay and appreciate your patience.

Upcoming Release
We are committed to open-source principles and plan to release the fully organized CSTDTI code as soon as possible. Once ready, the code will be uploaded to this repository, including detailed documentation, usage instructions, and example data. Please stay tuned for updates, and we will notify the community when the release is available.

Acknowledgments
We are deeply grateful for the recognition and support from the research community for our work on CSTDTI. Your interest and encouragement inspire us to continue improving and sharing our advancements in DTI prediction. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we prepare the code for public access.
